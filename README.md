# Your Roadmap to Mastering Modern C++

This is not a beginner's tutorial. This is a curated journey for the intermediate C++ developer ready to transcend mere syntax and truly master the language.

If you already understand the basics of classes, templates, and the STL but feel daunted by modern features, advanced patterns, and high-performance concepts, this repository is your blueprint. CppMasteryQuest is the structured path I would take today to transform from an intermediate coder into a confident C++ architect.

Here, we move beyond the fundamentals to tackle the features that define modern, robust, and efficient C++. Through meticulously designed code examples, real-world challenges, and deep dives into the standard library, this project will equip you with the profound understanding needed to not only ace technical interviews but also to design and build exceptional software.

## **Roadmap Overview**

The **C++ Mastery Quest** is divided into six months, each focusing on specific topics and challenges. Below is the structure of the roadmap, along with the resources available:

### **Month 1: Mastering Fundamentals**

**Objective:** Strengthen your grasp on intermediate concepts and fill foundational gaps.  

#### Weekly Themes

- **Week 1: Core Language & Mechanics**  
  - Templates, const correctness, smart pointers, Rule of Five/Zero, move semantics.  
  - Challenges: Build template-based data structures (e.g. stack/queue) with proper const-correctness + RAII.

- **Week 2: STL in Depth**  
  - Containers, iterators, algorithms, lambdas, complexity analysis, ranges (`C++20`).  
  - Challenges: Build a *Data Analyzer* that ingests text/CSV and computes stats using STL.

- **Week 3: Memory Mastery**  
  - RAII, dynamic allocation, alignment, cache, allocators, smart pointer internals.
  - Challenges: Implement your own `shared_ptr` â†’ then a simple custom allocator â†’ then expand to a memory pool.

- **Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, SOLID principles, design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer).  
  - Challenges: Build a *Plugin System* where new modules can be dynamically added and managed using OOP principles.

### **Upcoming Months** (Work in Progress)  

#### **Month 2: Deep Dive into Advanced Features**

- Move semantics, multithreading, compile-time programming, and C++20 features.  

#### **Month 3: Problem-Solving and Algorithms**

- Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and advanced data structures.  

#### **Month 4: Systems Programming and Performance**

- Low-level programming, performance optimization, file handling, and networking.  

#### **Month 5: Large-Scale Software Development**

- Modular design, testing, debugging, build systems, and design patterns.  

#### **Month 6: Real-World Applications and Open Source**

- GUI development, game development, open-source contributions, and portfolio projects.

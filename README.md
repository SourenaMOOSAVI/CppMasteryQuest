## 📌 **Roadmap Overview**

The **C++ Mastery Roadmap** is divided into six months, each focusing on specific topics and challenges. Below is the structure of the roadmap, along with the resources available:

### **Month 1: Mastering Fundamentals** ✅

**Objective:** Strengthen your grasp on intermediate concepts and fill foundational gaps.  

#### Weekly Themes:

- **Week 1: Core Syntax and Language Features**  
  - Learn templates, `const` correctness, and smart pointers.  
  - Challenges: Implement generic data structures (e.g., stack, queue).  

- **Week 2: Standard Library (STL)**  
  - Dive into STL containers, algorithms, and iterators.  
  - Challenges: Solve problems using STL (e.g., sorting, searching, custom comparators).  

- **Week 3: Memory Management**  
  - Understand dynamic allocation, RAII, and manual memory management.  
  - Challenges: Implement a custom `shared_ptr` and memory pool.  

- **Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Explore inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory).  
  - Challenges: Create a zoo management system using OOP principles.

### **Upcoming Months** (Work in Progress)  

#### **Month 2: Deep Dive into Advanced Features**

- Move semantics, multithreading, compile-time programming, and C++20 features.  

#### **Month 3: Problem-Solving and Algorithms**

- Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and advanced data structures.  

#### **Month 4: Systems Programming and Performance**

- Low-level programming, performance optimization, file handling, and networking.  

#### **Month 5: Large-Scale Software Development**

- Modular design, testing, debugging, build systems, and design patterns.  

#### **Month 6: Real-World Applications and Open Source**

- GUI development, game development, open-source contributions, and portfolio projects.

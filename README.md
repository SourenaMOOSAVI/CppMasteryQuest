# Your Roadmap to Mastering Modern C++

> This is not a beginner’s tutorial.  
> This is a curated journey for the **intermediate C++ developer** ready to transcend syntax and truly **master modern C++**.

If you already understand the basics of classes, templates, and the STL but feel daunted by advanced features, high-performance patterns, or modern idioms, this repository is your **blueprint**.  
**CppMasteryQuest** is the structured path I would take today to evolve from an intermediate coder into a confident **C++ architect**.

Through hands-on challenges, deep dives into the standard library, and real-world projects, this roadmap helps you develop the intuition, craftsmanship, and fluency required to build professional-grade, high-performance software.

---

## Roadmap Overview

The **C++ Mastery Quest** is divided into six months.  
Each month focuses on specific topics, challenges, and projects that build on one another — from mastering fundamentals to building real-world systems.

---

### **Month 1: Mastering Fundamentals**

**Objective:** Strengthen your grasp of intermediate concepts and fill foundational gaps.

#### Weekly Themes

- **[Week 1: Core Language & Mechanics](Month1/Week1/README.md)**  
  Templates, const correctness, smart pointers, Rule of Five/Zero, and move semantics.  
  *Challenge:* Build template-based data structures (`stack`, `queue`, `dynamic array`) with RAII and const-correctness.

- **[Week 2: STL in Depth](Month1/Week2/README.md)**  
  Containers, iterators, algorithms, lambdas, complexity analysis, and ranges (`C++20`).  
  *Challenge:* Build a **Data Analyzer** that ingests text/CSV files and computes stats using STL.

- **[Week 3: Memory Mastery](Month1/Week3/README.md)**  
  Dynamic allocation, alignment, caching, allocators, and smart pointer internals.  
  *Challenge:* Implement your own `shared_ptr`, then design a custom allocator and a memory pool.

- **[Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](Month1/Week4/README.md)**  
  Inheritance, polymorphism, SOLID principles, and common design patterns.  
  *Challenge:* Build a **Plugin System** with dynamically loaded modules.

---

### **Month 2: Advanced C++ Features**

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of compile-time programming, concurrency, and language internals.

- Move semantics, threading models, and advanced template metaprogramming.
- Dive into C++20 features: Concepts, Coroutines, and Modules.

---

### **Month 3: Problem Solving & Algorithms**

**Objective:** Strengthen algorithmic thinking using C++ as your weapon.

- Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and custom data structures.
- Focus on **complexity analysis**, **benchmarking**, and **code efficiency**.

---

### **Month 4: Systems Programming & Performance**

**Objective:** Go low-level and fast.

- Filesystems, sockets, and network programming.  
- Cache-aware programming, memory alignment, and profiling.  
- *Challenge:* Implement a multithreaded logger or a simple TCP server.

---

### **Month 5: Large-Scale Software Development**

**Objective:** Think and code like a software engineer.

- Modular design, build systems (CMake), testing (Catch2), debugging, and CI/CD.  
- *Challenge:* Build and test a mini-compiler or interpreter module.

---

### **Month 6: Real-World Applications & Open Source**

**Objective:** Apply everything you’ve learned.

- GUI apps, game dev, or open-source contributions.  
- Build a portfolio-ready project that showcases your C++ mastery.

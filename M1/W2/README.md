# STL Toolbox: Data Analyzer

The idea is to create a **data analysis tool** that reads numerical data from a file, processes it using STL containers, algorithms, and iterators, and provides meaningful statistics and transformations. This project focuses on leveraging the power of the Standard Template Library (STL) to solve practical problems efficiently.

## Concepts to Master

1. **STL Containers**:
   A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements. Containers can be divided into three categories: *sequence containers*, *associative containers*, and *container adapters*.

   - **Sequence Containers**: Implement data structures that can be accessed sequentially. They maintain the ordering of inserted elements that you specify. Common sequence containers are `array` and `vector`.
   - **Associative Containers**: Implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). In associative containers, elements are inserted in a pre-defined orderâ€”for example, as sorted ascending. Unordered associative containers are also available. The associative containers can be grouped into two subsets: `maps` and `sets`.
   - **Container Adapters**: A variation of a sequence or associative container that restricts the interface for simplicity and clarity. Container adapters don't support iterators. `stack` and `queue` are two common container adapters. `stack` adapts a container to provide stack (LIFO - last in, first out - data structure) and `queue` adapts a container to provide queue (FIFO - first in, first out - data structure).

2. **STL Algorithms**:
   Algorithms are a fundamental part of the C++ Standard Library. Algorithms don't work with containers themselves but rather with iterators. Therefore, the same algorithm can be used by most if not all of the C++ Standard Library containers. The Standard Library Algorithms can come in several categories:

   - **Non-modifying Algorithms**: These algorithms do not alter the contents of the container but perform operations like searching, counting, and checking properties. Examples: `std::find`, `std::count`, etc.
   - **Modifying Algorithms**: These algorithms modify the elements of the container or its structure. Examples: `std::copy`, `std::fill`, `std::remove`, etc.
   - **Sorting and Partitioning Algorithms**: These algorithms rearrange the elements of a container. Examples: `std::sort`, `std::partition`, etc.
   - **Set Algorithms**: These algorithms work on sorted ranges and perform set-like operations. Examples: `std::set_union`, `std::set_difference`, etc.
   - **Heap Algorithms**: These algorithms help work with heaps, which are specialized binary tree-like structures. Examples: `std::make_heap`, `std::push_heap`, etc.

3. **Iterators**:
   An **iterator** is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the container. We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container. They can be visualized as something similar to a pointer pointing to some location and we can access content at that particular location using them. Depending upon the functionality of iterators they can be classified into five categories:

   - **Input Iterators**: Used to read a sequence of values.
   - **Output Iterators**: Used to write a sequence of values.
   - **Forward Iterators**: Can be read, written, and moved forward.
   - **Bidirectional Iterators**: Can be read, written, and moved both forward and backward.
   - **Random-Access Iterators**: Can be read, written, and moved to any element in constant time.

4. **Custom Comparators and Lambda Functions**:
   Custom comparators and lambda functions are powerful features in C++ that allow you to define custom logic for sorting, searching, or transforming data. In this project, they are used extensively to demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the Standard Template Library (STL).

   - **Lambda Functions**: Lambda functions are anonymous functions that are defined in place, making them ideal for short, specific operations. They are written using the following syntax:

     ```cpp
     [ capture_clause ] ( parameters ) -> return_type { body }
     ```

     Example:

     ```cpp
     auto add = [](int a, int b) -> int { return a + b; };
     std::cout << add(2, 3); // Outputs: 5
     ```

   - **Custom Comparators**: Custom comparators are functions or lambda expressions used to define **custom sorting or comparison logic** for STL algorithms. These are particularly useful in operations like `std::sort`, `std::set`, or `std::priority_queue`.

     Example:

     ```cpp
     std::vector<int> data = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};
     std::sort(data.begin(), data.end(), [](int a, int b) { return a > b; }); // Sort in descending order
     ```

5. **File I/O with STL Streams**:
   File I/O operations are essential for reading and writing data to and from files. The C++ Standard Library provides a set of classes for file I/O operations, including `std::ifstream` for reading from files, `std::ofstream` for writing to files, and `std::fstream` for both reading and writing.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   std::ifstream inputFile("data.txt");
   std::vector<int> data;
   int value;
   while (inputFile >> value) {
       data.push_back(value);
   }
   inputFile.close();
   ```

## How to run the project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sourenamoosavi/stl-toolbox.git
    ```

2. **Build the project**:
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then, run the following command to compile the project:

    ```sh
    cd stl-toolbox
    make
    ```

3. **Run the executable**:
    After building the project, you can run the executable:

    ```sh
    ./data_analyzer
    ```

    you should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Usage: ./data_analyzer [options]
    Options:
    --sort            Sort the data
   --deduplicate     Remove duplicates
   --stats           Compute statistics (mean, median, mode, range)
   --transform       Apply transformations (e.g., square each value)
   --input=<file>    Input file path (required)
   --output=<file>   Output file path
   --help            Show this help message
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
    To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests:

    ```sh
    ./main_program --input=data/input.txt --output=data/output.txt --stats
    ```
